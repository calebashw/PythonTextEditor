# Python Text Editor
## Author: Caleb Ash

## Description
This is a simple text editor built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to create and edit text files, as well as track the total number of characters entered in real-time. The editor features basic text input capabilities with options to save files, change fonts, and count characters dynamically as you type.

## Features
- **Basic Text Editing**: Enter and edit text within a Tkinter-based interface.
- **File Saving**: Save your text to a file via a dialog, using save button or cmd/ctrl s.
- **Font Selection**: Choose between different fonts (e.g., Helvetica, Courier).
- **Character Count**: Real-time character count displayed in the interface, updating as you type.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports Python and Tkinter.

## Future Enhancements
- Add options for bold, italic, and underline text formatting.
- Implement file open functionality.
- Add additional features such as word count, find and replace, and dark mode.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python)
